	<p>All businesses face the threat of data loss…. This loss could be as a result of malicious activity or inadvertent mis-management, but the consequences for either can be similary catastrophic. All organisations, whether public sector or private sector, must take appropriate steps to safeguard their information and protect their data and reputation. </p>
      <h4>Clear Scope and Reporting Processes</h4>
      <p>BTRP can help you to assess your current network and website controls and help you to identify where there may be any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses, which may cause data to be lost. We can do this through using the same tools and techniques that a hacker would use to try and break into your network – the only difference is that we’re on YOUR side! We work with you to identify the scope and we never stray outside of it. We will report back to you upon finding anything that may compromise your information and we help you to close any gaps.</p>
      <h4>Qualified and Experienced</h4>
      <p>Our penetration testers are accredited to the government’s CHECK Team Member standard, having gained the Tiger Scheme Qualified Security Team Member accreditation. We have a whole host of other penetration testing accreditations and continually strive to keep up to date with new tools and techniques. Accreditations on their own don’t necessarily provide the level of comfort that clients need, which is why we ensure that our consultants have at least 10 years of experience in the information security and IT Audit fields.  </p>
    <h4>Best Practice Methodology</h4>
    <p>Our testing methodology is based upon best practices from the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) for web applications as well as key elements of other leading methodologies where needed.  </p>
